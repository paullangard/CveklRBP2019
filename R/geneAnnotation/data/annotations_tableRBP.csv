Cirbp,Stress response,"This combination with 18S rRNA not only indicates CIRP’s potential regulatory role in the translation process, but also veriﬁes that the CIRP recruited by SGs is partly via RNA-binding activities.

Igf2bp1,translational regulation,"Here we show that chicken ZBP1 modulates the translation of β-actin mRNA. ZBP1 associates with the β-actin transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation.

Khsrp,mRNA degradation,"Here, we demonstrate that KSRP, a KH domain-containing ARE-BP, is an essential factor for ARE-directed mRNA decay. Some of the KH motifs (KHs) of KSRP directly mediate RNA binding, mRNA decay, and interactions with the exosome and poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN). The ability of KHs to promote mRNA decay correlates with their ability to bind the ARE and associate with RNA-degrading enzymes. Thus, KHs promote rapid mRNA decay by recruiting degradation machinery to ARE-containing mRNAs.",15175153,2020-01-06T13:48:03Z
